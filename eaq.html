                    <h5>1. What Is Hybrid Marketing?</h5>
                    <p>
                      Hybrid marketing is a promotional based approach that
                      comprises traditional marketing and digital marketing.
                      Instead of focusing only on online platforms or in-person
                      touchpoints, hybrid marketing effectively merges both
                      approaches to create an even more effective and extensive
                      outreach plan.

                    <h5>1.1 Definition</h5>
                    <p>
                      Because it is a new term, there is no consensus on the
                      precise definition of hybrid marketing or whether it
                      should be considered a synonym for integrated marketing.
                      Broadly defined, though, hybrid marketing seeks to provide
                      a consistent business identity across traditional
                      marketing channels, such as TV and print, and online
                      channels, such as websites and social media outlets.

                    <p>
                      Hybrid marketing is a new and evolving term and is
                      sometimes referred to as omnichannel marketing or
                      multi-channel marketing. The terminology is flexible, and
                      so is the concept. Hybrid, omnichannel, and multi-channel
                      marketing are fluid approaches to promoting a brand,
                      product, or service through varied, yet cohesive methods.

                      Outlining A Hybrid Marketing Plan Like most marketing
                      strategies, a hybrid marketing plan starts with defining
                      your audience and goals. As you put together a campaign or

                      are from the same place. Use consistent branding elements,

                      Like branding, the hybrid marketing experience should also
                      feel smooth and coherent. Each customer touchpoint should
                      feel connected and united. Consider how your in-person and
                      online touchpoints interact with each other. Ensure that
                      if a customer sees something in your store or at a
                      tradeshow, they will find the same message on your online

                      While branding, messaging, and experiences should be

                      simply reuse it on another. Consider the nuances of each
                      platform and use creativity to adjust your content so it
                      matches the medium. For example, don’t republish printed
                      brochures as PDFs on your website. Change the content to
                      blog post text to match the native platform.

                    <p>
                      Though a decade ago, the fundamental drivers for adopting
                      an in-house agency model were cost savings and speed to
                      market, in today’s stronger economy, they aren’t alone in
                      driving this trend. Knowledge of the brand and need for
                      measurement and analytics and insights to drive new
                      programs and strategies are of paramount importance,
                      especially in digital marketing. Advertisers like P&G,
                      Unilever, and JPMorgan Chase have recognized this and have
                      been able to sustain a successful in-house digital
                      marketing model. However, some advertisers are going back
                      to agencies and ad tech vendors after struggling to run
                      digital marketing services themselves. Brands like Mazda,
                      Adidas, and Heineken are opting out from completely moving
                      to the in-house agency model. Difficulty in recruiting
                      qualified personnel, challenges in developing/maintaining
                      digital tools in-house, need for delivering on commercial
                      outcomes, brand measures and overall performance are the
                      main reasons.

                      All this is because retail businesses have to keep up with
                      the hyper-competitive and ever-changing retail landscape,
                      where digital and physical retailing are truly becoming
                      one. The recent trends show that the hybrid model, also
                      known as the “Marketplace Model,” is disrupting the
                      conventional brick-and-mortar and online retailing as
                      stand-alone businesses. Even the big players of the Indian
                      e-retail market Snapdeal and Flipkart have initiated to
                      set up their offline stores in different cities. The

                      As you approach the problem of marketing your business,
                      you can find yourself overwhelmed by both the sheer volume
                      and the often contradictory nature of the advice. After
                      all, websites and content marketing bear little apparent
                      resemblance to print ads and commercials. Yet, print ads,
                      websites, articles, and commercials each function as one
                      possible marketing channel among many. Hybrid marketing
                      tries to bridge the gaps among marketing channels.

                    <p>
                      As brand marketing expert Steve McKee points out,
                      integrative marketing of any kind requires more than
                      simply using the same slogan or the same color scheme
                      everywhere. However, for the novitiate, those offer places
                      to start, particularly if you employ different companies
                      for different areas of your marketing. Using different
                      color schemes on your website, business cards and in your
                      print ads muddles your brand. Color consistency helps to
                      reinforce your brand across marketing channels.

                    <p>
                      When you prepare a hybrid marketing strategy, the message
                      must remain consistent across all channels. This can mean
                      a considerable amount of work. Direct-response sales
                      letters work by using text to shine an intense light on
                      benefits. Radio ads, which do not and cannot communicate
                      in the same way, require a different strategy to get the
                      same message across. You need to make sure that everyone
                      involved with your marketing knows the exact message you
                      want to convey to ensure consistency.

                    <p>
                      To get the most out of a hybrid marketing strategy, the
                      marketing materials should go live on every channel at the
                      same time. This supports the consistency of brand and
                      message. This does not mean you need to saturate all of
                      the market channels with new marketing materials the same
                      day. Just make sure to phase out any old marketing
                      materials that do not reflect the new brand, color scheme
                      and message for the business or product. Leaving old
                      materials active in marketing channels, much like having
                      different color schemes in different marketing channels,
                      muddles the brand.

                      Social media poses a particular challenge to effective
                      hybrid marketing. Most marketing channels operate in one
                      direction: from the business to the consumer. Social
                      media, by nature, allows for an interactive experience
                      between business and consumers. Business owners should
                      take particular care in the selection of those people
                      allowed to post on social media sites for the business.
                      One careless post by an employee can take on a life of its
                      own in social media and cause significant damage to the
                      business.

                      A hybrid campaign might be a mix of impression-based (CPM)
                      and performance-based (CPC or CPA), or a mix of two
                      performance-based models. Hybrid deals are sometimes seen
                      as a way to further split the risk between publishers and
                      advertisers. Advertising campaigns sometimes bundle CPM
                      and CPC in a hybrid buy, and sometimes even CPA. Affiliate
                      programs have been known to offer a few cents per-click in
                      addition to paying for a sale, lead, download, or other
                      conversion activity.

                      Call centers are faced with high volumes of calls per day,
                      particularly given today’s ultra-focused emphasis on
                      tech-centric products. But the inquiries on resolving
                      hiccups from smart devices also means higher chances of
                      having a question too advanced for a customer service
                      agent. Typically, these agents have a script handy in
                      order to find any information they need for the usual
                      inquiry on a device. But if the question is too complex
                      and falls outside of the script, we have a problem. When a
                      customer realizes that their question cannot be answered,
                      they can become irritated at the fact that there is no
                      solution, especially if they were put on hold for a
                      lengthy period of time before they could even speak with
                      an agent. Both parties are at a disadvantage to each other
                      and a proper solution is needed for efficient customer
                      service that benefits the agent and customer.

                      We have two sides of the interaction line, the agents and
                      customers, and we want to be able to resolve the problems
                      of each side to benefit the success of the business.
                      Agents want vital information and better handling of
                      customer calls, and customers want to be helped quickly
                      and efficiently without being stuck taking a number slip
                      to wait. This is where a new hybrid solution is deemed as
                      an apart solution. The hybrid solution mixes the
                      traditional service of an agent and the digital
                      self-support materials found on a brand’s website. By
                      making a special combo of the two, it creates benefits to
                      both the agent, to deliver better service, and the
                      customer, to receive better service. These support
                      materials, such as FAQ’s, interactive how-to tutorials,
                      and informative videos, create a fast source of solutions
                      to inquiries.

                      Understanding the hybrid solution gives a better
                      understanding of why it works so well. With the mix of
                      support materials and customer service agents, a business
                      runs more smoothly and the brand receives better praise
                      amongst customers. Each component of the hybrid solution
                      has its own perks for an overall high-quality product.
                      Support materials are available online as assistance to
                      customers who have inquiries about their smart devices.
                      Online, customers can expect the support materials listed
                      earlier as well as converse with a chatbot when they
                      aren’t the type to actually want to speak to a real
                      customer service agent. This helps customers avoid the
                      hassle of waiting for a long time to speak to an agent,
                      and they can gain knowledge to resolve their own device
                      dilemmas. These support materials are also a perk for
                      customer service agents. As more customers convert to a
                      self-support strategy, fewer calls will come in. Thus,
                      customers who aren’t as tech-savvy can be on the phone
                      with an agent who also has access to these support
                      materials and can better resolve their problems. This
                      hybrid solution is a critical solution for businesses
                      today. This resolves not only the typical customer
                      inquiries seuss also the problems customers face with the
                      traditional customer care system and the problems agents
                      faced with being limited to the sometimes-outdated script
                      they had.
