                  require applications to respect your privacy, and your
                  agreement with that application will control how the
                  application can use, store, and transfer that content and
                  information. When you publish content or information using the
                  Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone,

                  You give us permission to use your name, profile picture,

                  sponsored, or related content (such as a brand you like)

                  name and/or profile picture with your content or information,

                  We do not give your content or information to advertisers

                  <b>Special Provisions Applicable to Advertisers</b
                  ><br /><br />

                  You can target your desired audience by buying ads on Nearby
                  Grocer or our publisher network. The following additional
                  terms apply to you if you place an order through our online
                  advertising portal (Order):<br /><br />

                  When you place an order, you will tell us the type of
                  advertising you want to buy, the amount you want to spend, and
                  your bid. If we accept your Order, we will deliver your ads as
                  inventory becomes available. When serving your ad, we do our
                  best to deliver the ads to the audience you specify, although
                  we cannot guarantee in every instance that your ad will reach
                  its intended target.<br /><br />

                  In instances where we believe doing so will enhance the
                  effectiveness of your advertising campaign, we may broaden the
                  targeting criteria you specify.<br /><br />

                  You will pay for your Orders in accordance with our Payment
                  terms. The amount you owe will be calculated based on our
                  tracking mechanisms.<br /><br />

                  Your ads will comply with our Advertising Guidelines.<br /><br />

                  We will determine the size, placement, and positioning of your
                  ads.<br /><br />

                  We do not guarantee the activity that your ads will receive,
                  such as the number of clicks your ads will get.<br /><br />

                  We cannot control how clicks are generated in your ads. We
                  have systems that attempt to detect and filter certain click
                  activity, but we are not responsible for click fraud,
                  technological issues, or other potentially invalid click
                  activity that may affect the cost of running ads.<br /><br />

                  You can cancel your Order at any time through our online
                  portal, but it may take up to 24 hours before the ad stops
                  running. You are responsible for paying for all ads that
                  run.<br /><br />

                  Our license to run your ad will end when we have completed
                  your Order. You understand, however, that if users have
                  interacted with your ad, your ad may remain until the users
                  delete it.<br /><br />

                  We can use your ads and related content and information for
                  marketing or promotional purposes.<br /><br />

                  You will not issue any press release or make public statements
                  about your relationship with Nearby Grocer without our prior
                  written permission.<br /><br />

                  We may reject or remove any ad for any reason.<br /><br />

                  If you are placing ads on someone else's behalf, you must have
                  permission to place those ads, including the following:<br /><br />

                  You warrant that you have the legal authority to bind the
                  advertiser to this Statement.<br /><br />

                  You agree that if the advertiser you represent violates this
                  Statement, we may hold you responsible for that violation.<br /><br />

                  Below terms & conditions derives from the Nearby Grocer
                  Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our

                  Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance.
                  Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this
                  document that helps you understand how Nearby Grocer works.<br /><br />

                  <b>Privacy</b><br /><br />

                  your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Use
                  Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use
                  Nearby Grocer to share with others and how we collect and use
                  your content and information. We encourage you to read the
                  Data Use Policy and to use it to help you make informed
                  decisions.<br /><br />

                  <b>Sharing Your Content and Information</b><br /><br />

                  You own all of the content and information you post on Nearby
                  Grocer, and you can control how it is shared through your
                  privacy and application settings. In addition:<br /><br />

                  For content that is covered by intellectual property rights,
                  like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us
                  the following permission, subject to your privacy and
                  application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive,
                  transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license
                  to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with
                  Nearby Grocer (IP License). This IP License ends when you
                  delete your IP content or your account unless you’re content
                  has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.<br /><br />

                  When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar
                  to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you
                  understand that removed content may persist in backup copies
                  for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to
                  others).<br /><br />

                  When you use an application, the application may ask for your
                  permission to access your content and information as well as
                  content and information that others have shared with you. We
                  require applications to respect your privacy, and your
                  agreement with that application will control how the
                  application can use, store, and transfer that content and
                  information. When you publish content or information using the
                  Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone,
                  including people off of Nearby Grocer, to access and use that
                  information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and
                  profile picture).<br /><br />

                  We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about
                  Nearby Grocer, but you understand that we may use them without

                  About Advertisements and Other Commercial Content Served or
                  Enhanced by Nearby Grocer<br /><br />

                  Our goal is to deliver advertising and other commercial or
                  sponsored content that is valuable to our users and
                  advertisers. In order to help us do that, you agree to the
                  following:<br /><br />

                  You give us permission to use your name, profile picture,
                  content, and information in connection with commercial,
                  sponsored, or related content (such as a brand you like)
                  served or enhanced by us. This means, for example, that you
                  permit a business or other entity to pay us to display your
                  name and/or profile picture with your content or information,
                  without any compensation to you. If you have selected a
                  specific audience for your content or information, we will
                  respect your choice when we use it.<br /><br />

                  We do not give your content or information to advertisers
                  without your consent.<br /><br />

                  You understand that we may not always identify paid services
                  and communications as such.<br /><br />

                  Special Provisions Applicable to Advertisers<br /><br />

                  You can target your desired audience by buying ads on Nearby
                  Grocer or our publisher network. The following additional
                  terms apply to you if you place an order through our online
                  advertising portal (Order):<br /><br />

                  When you place an order, you will tell us the type of
                  advertising you want to buy, the amount you want to spend, and
                  your bid. If we accept your Order, we will deliver your ads as
                  inventory becomes available. When serving your ad, we do our
                  best to deliver the ads to the audience you specify, although
                  we cannot guarantee in every instance that your ad will reach
                  its intended target.<br /><br />

                  In instances where we believe doing so will enhance the
                  effectiveness of your advertising campaign, we may broaden the
                  targeting criteria you specify.<br /><br />

                  You will pay for your Orders in accordance with our Payment
                  terms. The amount you owe will be calculated based on our
                  tracking mechanisms.<br /><br />

                  Your ads will comply with our Advertising Guidelines.<br /><br />

                  We will determine the size, placement, and positioning of your
                  ads.<br /><br />

                  We do not guarantee the activity that your ads will receive,
                  such as the number of clicks your ads will get.<br /><br />

                  We cannot control how clicks are generated in your ads. We
                  have systems that attempt to detect and filter certain click
                  activity, but we are not responsible for click fraud,
                  technological issues, or other potentially invalid click
                  activity that may affect the cost of running ads.<br /><br />

                  You can cancel your Order at any time through our online
                  portal, but it may take up to 24 hours before the ad stops
                  running. You are responsible for paying for all ads that
                  run.<br /><br />

                  Our license to run your ad will end when we have completed
                  your Order. You understand, however, that if users have
                  interacted with your ad, your ad may remain until the users
                  delete it.<br /><br />

                  We can use your ads and related content and information for
                  marketing or promotional purposes.<br /><br />

                  You will not issue any press release or make public statements
                  about your relationship with Nearby Grocer without our prior
                  written permission.<br /><br />

                  We may reject or remove any ad for any reason.<br /><br />

                  If you are placing ads on someone else's behalf, you must have
                  permission to place those ads, including the following:<br /><br />

                  You warrant that you have the legal authority to bind the
                  advertiser to this Statement.<br /><br />

                  You agree that if the advertiser you represent violates this
                  Statement, we may hold you responsible for that violation.<br /><br />

                  Special Provisions Applicable to Pages<br /><br />

                  upgrades, updates and additional features from us in order to
                  improve, enhance, and further develop the software.<br /><br />

                  or we give you express written permission.<br /><br />

                  Amendments<br /><br />

                  Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons,
                  or to correct an inaccurate statement, we will provide you

                  Your continued use of Nearby Grocer following changes to our
                  terms constitutes your acceptance of our amended terms.<br /><br />
